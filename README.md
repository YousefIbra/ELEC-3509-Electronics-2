# ELEC-3509-Electronics-2

**Objective:** To study the principles, design and analysis of analog electronic circuits.

**Learning Outcomes:**

1) Design DC bias circuits; selection of alternative bias schemes and understanding of their
comparative advantages and disadvantages; determine the DC operating voltages and
currents for a circuit containing up to ten transistors.

2) Design of small-signal amplifiers; determine the small signal-gain, input impedance, and
output impedance of an amplifier consisting of two transistors; determine the operating
bandwidth of a simple amplifier; selection of basic types of amplifiers and understanding of
their comparative advantages and disadvantages.

3) Analyze simple op-amps at the transistor level to determine gain, common-mode range, and
slew rate. Analyze basic power amplifiers to determine efficiency and maximum output
power.

4) Design op-amp based filters from required specifications on frequency-domain responses;
determine filter type, Q, gain, and corner frequency of 2nd order op-amp based filters;
alternative choices of several basic types of 2nd order active filters and understanding of their
comparative advantages and disadvantages..

5) Apply the Barkhausen Criteria to circuits to test if they oscillate and if they do determine
under what conditions this occurs.
